# PlantPilot
This is Plant-Pilot, the seamless integration of hardware and software using Raspberry pi.

The basic idea is to use the raspberry pi get it connected sensors such as moisture and temerature which helps us determine the favorable growing conditions for the plant. 

#                         How To Right ? 

1. Place the Plant Pilot sensor into one of your house plants.
2. Add that plant to your garden via the home page or the custom plant creation feature on the garden page.
3. Use Plant Pilot to keep track of and compare your Plant's soil moisture and temperature with the recommended ranges.
A. Cosider watering your plant more or less based on the suggested range.
5. Watch your plant grow to maturity and live a healthy life!

# How we came across this idea?

The idea was suggested by our friend Mr.Joel. It was a real issue for student and parent (not specified for privacy) and we came across this and thought we could help. The project was completed by Joel Porter, Hassaan Bukhari, Prashant Neupane at Louisiana Tech University during their freshman year. Major contributions was done by Joel(https://github.com/Joel-ajp).

#Things to Develop and Build

We were trying to create a function so that it could send out automated message when the temperature not favorable but couldnot complete it due to the time limitation for the project.
